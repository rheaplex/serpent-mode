serpent-mode.el
===============

By Rob Myers <rob@robyers.org>

Emacs support for editing Serpent code.


Installation
============

Major Mode
----------

To install the Emacs major mode, add the file serpent-mode.el to your Emacs
load path. You can then load it by typing the following in Emacs:

 M-x serpent-mode

Alternatively you can have Emacs load it automatically for files with a .moo
extension by adding the following to your .emacs file:
 
(require 'serpent-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.se$" . serpent-mode))

Autocomplete
------------

To install the autocomplete dictionary, copy the file ``serpent-mode'' to the
autocomplete directory in your autoload dictionary directory. e.g.:

cp serpent-mode ~/.emacs.d/ac-dict

Then rebuild the autocomplete cache by typing the following in Emacs:

M-x ac-clear-dictionary-cache

Other Files
-----------

You don't need to install dev-serpent-mode.el, it just contains code used in
making the regular expressions used by serpent-mode.el .
